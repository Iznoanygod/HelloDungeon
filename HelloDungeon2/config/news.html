<h1>HelloDungeon2 Public Alpha is Out!</h1>
<p>After months of development, I can finally announce that I am taking HelloDungeon2 out of initial development and putting it in its Alpha phase. This will include most parts of the game, and more features will be added as I continue to develop the game. Check back often for more updates in the future</p>
